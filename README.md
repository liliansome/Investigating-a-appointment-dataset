# Investigating-a-appointment-dataset
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

What's there to learn?
After completing the project, we will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings



Step One - Choose the  Data Set

Step Two - Get Organized
The report communicating your findings
Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)

Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options to help you get started.

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.

Step Five - Review
